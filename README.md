RoundR
======
### Introducing RoundR
RoundR serves a simple purpose; To round the corners of your screen. RoundR is licensed under Apache 2.0.

### Functionality
RoundR takes advantage of the fact that regardless of the device's color, the screen is surrounded with a pitch black border, the corners of which are rarely ever touched. RoundR places four small overlays at the corners of the display, to simulate a rounded screen.

### Source Code
RoundR uses Mark Wei's Brilliant StandOut library to display the overlays. The source code for Mark's library (tweaked) & RoundR can Be found here on GitHub.
